# The-Bin-packing-Problem
### Project based on Data Structures and Algorithms

In the bin packing problem, items of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of a fixed given volume in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. In computational complexity theory, it is a combinatorial NP-hard problem. The decision problem (deciding if items will fit into a specified number of bins) is NP-complete.
